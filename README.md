# InfraMind - The Self-Healing Backend Brain

> **Mission Status:** 21-Day MVP Offensive - DAY 1  
> **Objective:** Establish Beachhead Against Backend Chaos

## 🎯 Commander's Intent

InfraMind is not another backend framework. It's a weapon against invisible complexity that kills productivity and destroys teams. This MVP proves our ability to deliver ruthless precision in backend operations.

## ⚡ 21-Day Victory Conditions

- [x] **Day 1:** Project initialization and foundation setup
- [ ] **Day 3:** Spring Boot 3.x + Security + Actuator operational
- [ ] **Day 7:** Docker containerization complete
- [ ] **Day 10:** GitHub Actions pipeline functional
- [ ] **Day 14:** Swagger UI integrated with live documentation
- [ ] **Day 21:** **DEPLOYMENT READY MVP**

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the battlefield
git clone https://github.com/ahammednibras8/InfraMind.git
cd InfraMind

# Deploy locally (Docker required)
docker-compose up --build

# Verify deployment
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
InfraMind MVP Stack
├── Spring Boot 3.x          # Battle-tested foundation
├── Spring Security           # Fortress-grade protection  
├── Spring Actuator          # Operational intelligence
├── Docker + Compose         # Deployment consistency
├── GitHub Actions           # Automated supply line
└── Swagger UI               # Live API intelligence
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Core Operations
- `GET /actuator/health` - System vitals
- `GET /actuator/info` - Deployment intelligence
- `GET /api/v1/status` - InfraMind operational status

### Documentation
- `GET /swagger-ui.html` - Live API map (available post-deployment)

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Local development
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Build Docker image
docker build -t infra-mind:latest .

# Run tests
./mvnw test

# Package for deployment
./mvnw clean package
```

## 🔒 Security Configuration

- Spring Security enabled with basic authentication
- Actuator endpoints secured
- CORS configured for development
- Production security hardening ready for post-MVP

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

- Spring Actuator health checks
- JVM metrics exposed
- Application metrics ready
- Docker health checks configured

## 🚦 Pipeline Status

| Component | Status | Last Updated |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Build | ![Build Status](https://github.com/your-org/infra-mind/workflows/CI/badge.svg) | Continuous |
| Tests | ![Test Status](https://github.com/your-org/infra-mind/workflows/Tests/badge.svg) | Continuous |
| Deploy | ![Deploy Status](https://github.com/your-org/infra-mind/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg) | On Release |

## 🎯 MVP Success Metrics

- **Deployment Time:** < 2 minutes from clone to running
- **API Response:** < 100ms for core endpoints  
- **Pipeline Execution:** < 5 minutes build-to-deploy
- **Documentation:** 100% endpoint coverage in Swagger

## 🚫 What We DON'T Do (MVP Constraints)

- No microservices complexity (monolith first)
- No database integration (file-based config for MVP)
- No advanced monitoring (basic Actuator only)
- No UI beyond Swagger documentation
- No external integrations beyond core stack

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Builds the application
2. Runs all tests
3. Creates Docker image
4. Validates deployment readiness
5. Updates documentation

## 📋 Environment Requirements

- **Java:** 17 or higher
- **Docker:** 20.0+ with Compose V2
- **Memory:** Minimum 512MB for container
- **Ports:** 8080 (application), 8081 (management)

## 🎖️ Contributing to Victory

1. Clone repository
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/tactical-improvement`
3. Commit with intent: `git commit -m "feat: add operational capability X"`
4. Push to battlefield: `git push origin feature/tactical-improvement`
5. Create Pull Request with mission briefing

## 📞 Command Structure

- **Project Lead:** `https://github.com/ahammednibras8`
- **Repository:** `https://github.com/ahammednibras8/InfraMind`
- **Documentation:** This README + inline code documentation
- **Issues:** GitHub Issues for tactical problems only

## ⚠️ Rules of Engagement

1. **MVP FIRST:** No feature additions outside defined scope
2. **PIPELINE SACRED:** Never break the CI/CD workflow
3. **DOCUMENTATION MANDATORY:** Every endpoint, every config decision
4. **SECURITY NON-NEGOTIABLE:** No shortcuts on authentication/authorization
5. **PERFORMANCE BASELINE:** Maintain sub-100ms response times
